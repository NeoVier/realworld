# realworld

This is inspired by [the real world app](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld),
a [Medium](https://medium.com) clone called Conduit. An official implementation
can be found [here](https://demo.realworld.io/#/).

Every implementation must follow these specs:

- [Frontend specs](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/tree/master/spec)
- [API specs](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/tree/master/api)

The implementations are supposed to be modular, so that any frontend implementation
can work with any backend implementation.
