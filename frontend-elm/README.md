# elm-starter

This is a simple template repository to act as a starting point for developing
simple [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) projects.

It uses Yarn as the package manager, just so we can install Elm
[Parcel](https://parceljs.org/). You can start a live server with
`yarn run start`, or make a production build with `yarn run build`.

This repository was based on
[this blog post](https://blog.hercules-ci.com/elm/2018/11/21/using-elm-and-parcel-for-zero-configuration-web-asset-management/).
